Desert locust plagues are still a threat to vegetation and agricultural lands in Africa and Asia as the recent outbreak in East Africa demonstrates. This is because it is a complex task to predict when and where desert locust will start breeding as this depends on several environmental conditions. Previous work covered the creation of machine learning models which can be used to classify areas based on storkroutes and environmental factors as breeding risk areas for desert locusts.  This work is about creating a cloud service which monitors the relevant parameters in real-time and uses the provided models to identify risk areas.
