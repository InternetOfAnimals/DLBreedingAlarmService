 Desert locust plagues are still a threat to vegetation and agricultural lands in Africa and Asia as the recent outbreak in East Africa demonstrates. This is because it is a complex task to predict when and where desert locust will start breeding as this depends on several environmental conditions. Previous work covered the creation of machine learning models as well as building a micro service which uses this models to  identify in real-time risk areas for locust breeding.

The process starting with the service' code in a  github repository, via creating a docker image  up to the deployed service running in the Cloud  has to  defined and implemented
